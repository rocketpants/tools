# Style guide

In general we try to stay as close to the standard .NET styles as is comfortable so this document mostly covers the instances in which we deviate from it.

## Indentation
* Four spaces.

## Line feeds
* Unix style line feeds.

## Scopes
* Curly braces are placed on the same line because we aren't animals.

## Class variables
* Public variables start with a capital letter.
* Private variables start with a small letter.
